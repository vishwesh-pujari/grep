How to embed python code in C
Include a spelling checker in grep
sudo apt-get install python3-dev
python-dev contains the header files you need to build Python extensions. lxml is a Python C-API extension that is compiled when you do pip install lxml. The lxml sources have at least something like #include <Python.h> in the code. The compiler looks for the Python.h file during compilation, hence those files need to be on your system such that they can be found. On Linux typically, the binary libraries and header files of packages like python are separate. Hence you can have Python installed and everything works fine but when you want to build extensions you need to install the corresponding dev package.

grep -r "main" *.c or grep -r "main" *.txt only checks for .c or .txt files in the same directory
They don't check .c or .txt files in the subdirectories
We can use --include or --exclude here for solving this problem

However grep -r "main" * works
Improve this problem

For binary files just print that ./a.out matched

grep without options like -E or -F considers the regex as basic regex
-G indicates basic regex. This is the default
In basic regex [a-z] is allowed but [a-z]+ doesn't mean repetition of [a-z], It assumes + as literal character

In basic regex while regcomp() we use 0 and not REG_EXTENDED or anything

For extended Regex use -E

-F indicates fixed string. i.e indicate options as strings and not patterns
Here use strstr() instead

Add another flag which states how u want the files to be interpreted. As regular expressions or fixed strings
eg *.txt in terms of regex can be any file ending with .txt. Convert regex to .*\.txt
Also *.txt also can be a file named *.txt literally

In file names we only have to handle the *
We can by default consider * has .* regular expression
But we can consider another option which tells that consider * as character literal in filename

Here write program like cat and display highlighted text. Also show line numbers. It is like showing matches in context of the file

Grep to replace words in a file
Also we can give the starting line number to replace
