File Handling library : 

We have to write code for fopen(), fread(), fwrite(), ...
Read man pages of all of these

On top of hardware, we have the OS, and OS gives us functions like open(), read(), write(), lseek()

fopen() calls open() in its code. So all fopen(), fread() functions are wrapper functions

Handling buffered array in case of file handling library is important

Standard File Descriptors : 0, 1, 2

Grep : 
opendir(), readdir(), stat(), chmod(), getopt(), mkdir()
getopt() is for getting command line argument

findstr is the command which is the alternative for grep in windows

Now here the name of the file also must be considered as a regular expression
Include a flag which will only print the first match in the entire directory  :   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14093452/grep-only-the-first-match-and-stop
